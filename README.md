# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project highlights my approach to the introductory machine learning competition on Kaggle website- Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This project analyses which people were likely to survive. In particular, tools of machine learning have been used to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
